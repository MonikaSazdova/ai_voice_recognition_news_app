# voice_controlled_news_app
Voice controlled React News App, using Alan AI (Software that allows adding voice capabilities to apps). For styling I used Material-UI. The design is simple, clean and responsive. Try playing with Alan. You can ask him to give you different news, you can have a small chat with him, or ask him to tell you more about me.
